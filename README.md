# üìä econflux

**econflux** is a simulation engine designed to explore the statistical behavior of socio-economic systems through a physics-inspired lens.

Traditional economic models often rely on vast numbers of variables and assumptions, making them hard to interpret or generalize. In contrast, **econflux** aims to simplify this complexity by applying principles from statistical physics‚Äîfocusing on randomness, probability, and emergent behavior‚Äîto simulate and analyze economic scenarios.

## üåê Purpose

The primary goal of econflux is to help researchers, educators, and analysts:

- **Model complex societies** under variable economic, demographic, and environmental conditions.
- **Simulate different normalization strategies**, such as taxation or wealth redistribution policies.
- **Generate large-scale, repeatable datasets** using controlled randomness and Monte Carlo methods.
- **Understand the statistical outcomes** of various social and economic interventions over time.

It provides a structured and configurable way to run scenario-based simulations that can reveal non-obvious patterns and help evaluate policy effects in a controlled environment.

## üéØ Use Cases

- Educational tools to demonstrate the statistical nature of economic behavior.
- Policy prototyping for income distribution, taxation, or basic income scenarios.
- Social research into inequality, opportunity, and system optimization.
- Preprocessing tool for machine learning pipelines in socio-economic analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Configurable population groups and initial conditions.
- Randomized scenario generation with seed support for reproducibility.
- Parameterized normalization functions (e.g., taxes, subsidies, investments).
- Monte Carlo simulations for robust statistical output.
- Output formats including CSV, JSON, and Parquet for downstream analysis.

## üöÄ Why Rust?

Rust ensures performance, safety, and portability. With native support for multi-platform builds, **econflux** can be compiled into lightweight binaries for use in academic research, data pipelines, or wrapped into other programming languages.

## üì¶ Getting Started

A command-line tool `econflux` is provided to run simulations easily. Pre-built binaries and detailed examples will be made available soon.
